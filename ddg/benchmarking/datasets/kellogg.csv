# 
# This dataset of mutations originates from the paper by Kellogg et al. [1]. We have made some changes from the original
# dataset. In particular, we have tried to match the DDG values to the original publications.
# 
# The DSSPType column lists the DSSP secondary structure type assigned by mkdssp 2.2.1 [2, 3]. The DSSPSimpleSSType column
# lists a simple elision of the DSSP types: G, H, and I become H(elix); E becomes S(heet); and T, B, S, and C become O(ther).

# This dataset was last updated on 2015-01-29.

# The RecordID below refers to the record ID in the original dataset. When no ID was specified, we added an ID based on the published order of the records.
# Mutations is an underscore-separated list of mutations. Each mutation takes the form "Chain Wildtype ResidueID Mutant".
# DDG is the aggregated (mean) DDG value used for analysis.
# IndividualDDGs lists the individual DDG values which can be used to filter out records with high variance.
# ResidueExposures is an underscore-separated list of exposure values, each one corresponding to its respective mutated position. Each exposure value is based on the solvent accessibility reported by DSSP divided by a maximum solvent accessibility for that residue type and represents whether the residue is buried (0.0) or exposed (1.0).
# DSSPTypes is an underscore-separated list of DSSP secondary structure assignments, each one corresponding to its respective mutated position.
# DSSPSimpleTypes is an underscore-separated list of DSSPSimpleType secondary structure assignments, each one corresponding to its respective mutated position.
# Note: The .json file accompanying this CSV file contains more information, including a list of publications from where the DDG values were taken.
